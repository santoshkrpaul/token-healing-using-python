      The token_healing() function takes two arguments: input_text (the text to be corrected) and correction_map (a dictionary containing token replacements).

The input text is split into tokens using the re.split() function. The regular expression pattern r'\s+' matches one or more whitespace characters as the delimiter.

The for loop iterates through each token in the input text using the enumerate() function to also access the index of each token.

Inside the loop, it checks if the current token exists in the correction map using the in operator.

If a token is found in the correction map, it replaces the token with its corrected form by assigning the corrected value to the corresponding index in the tokens list.

After processing all the tokens, the corrected tokens are joined back into a single string using the join() method with a space delimiter.

The corrected text is returned from the token_healing() function.

In the main() function:

The input text is defined as a string with some intentional misspelled tokens.
The correction map is defined as a dictionary with the misspelled tokens as keys and their intended corrected forms as values.
The token_healing() function is called with the input text and correction map as arguments.
The corrected text is printed to the console.
